  <h1>Image without width limit</h1>

  <p>An example of using <code>&lt;img-fixheight&gt;</code>, the image content is cropped and centered, with a fixed
    height of 560px at 1x. Width corresponds to page width. You can use your favorite developer tools to use this page
    at different widths, scale factors, and see how the banner is responsive.
  </p>

  <img-fixheight srcpattern="imgdemo/banner_::::.png" alt="Main banner"
                 height=560 widths="[480, 960, 1260, 1920, 2500]" ratios="[1, 2, 3]">
  </img-fixheight>

  <h1>Image with width limit</h1>

  <p>Same example than previous, but with limitmaxwidth attribute. This will use the maximum value specified in widths
    and limit the maximum width to it, whatever scale factor is used.</p>

  <div>
    <img-fixheight srcpattern="imgdemo/banner_::::.png" alt="Main banner" limitmaxwidth
                   height=560 widths="[480, 960, 1260, 1920, 2500]" ratios="[1, 2, 3]">
    </img-fixheight>
  </div>

</body>
